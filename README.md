**Tic-tac-toe** (American English)

**Noughts and crosses** (Commonwealth English)

**Xs and Os** (Canadian or Irish English)

Is a paper-and-pencil game for _two players_ who take turns marking the spaces in a _three-by-three grid_, one with _Xs_ and the other with _Os_.

**A player wins when they mark all three spaces of a row, column, or diagonal of the grid**, whereupon they traditionally draw a line through those three marks to indicate the win.

It is a _solved_ game, with a _forced draw_ assuming best play from both players.
